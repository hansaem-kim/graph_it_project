# Graph It

## Background

Graph It is an educational game designed to facilitate learning on graphing equations. It promotes engaging and positive learning experience where students can discover how graph works.

To win the game, a player must catch every star on the graph. A player can type in multiple equations to create lines on the graph. Once ready, press the car! The car will follow the line to catch stars on its way.

## Functionality
* Depend on difficulty level, the game generates different number of stars on the screen.
* Given a linear equation, it graphs the line on a 2D cartesian coordinate system.
* Player can type in any linear equation (up to 5 equations).
* Reset button resets the equations and lines on the screen.
* Instruction button displays the rules of the game.
* Pressing the car image starts the car to follow the line on the screen.
* When car catches every star, the game moves on to the next level.

## Implementation Timeline
###	Friday 
* Review Canvas. 
* Research and come up with basic outlines to start the project organized.
###	Weekend
* Build logics to take an input from user and render its graphs on the screen.
###	Monday
* Create “instruction”, “create”, and “logic” buttons.
###	Tuesday
* Build logics for car movements and star generation.
###	Wednesday
* Finish styling. Add nav links.

## Bonus Features
